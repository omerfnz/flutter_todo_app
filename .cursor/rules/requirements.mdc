# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a Flutter Todo application called "Görev Yöneticisi" (Task Manager). The application will be a modern, minimalist todo management app that follows strict architectural patterns including BLoC state management, dependency injection with GetIt, local storage with Hive, and internationalization support. The app will operate exclusively in dark mode with Material 3 design principles.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Core Todo Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want to manage my todo tasks with basic CRUD operations, so that I can organize and track my daily tasks effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app launches THEN the system SHALL display a list of all saved todo tasks
2. WHEN the todo list is empty THEN the system SHALL display an informative message "Harika! Hiç görevin kalmamış."
3. WHEN a user taps the floating action button THEN the system SHALL open a dialog/modal for adding new tasks
4. WHEN a user enters a task title and saves THEN the system SHALL add the task to the list with a unique ID
5. WHEN a user marks a task as completed THEN the system SHALL update the task status and display it with strikethrough text
6. WHEN a user swipes a task item THEN the system SHALL provide a dismissible action to delete the task
7. WHEN a task is deleted THEN the system SHALL remove it from both the UI and local storage

### Requirement 2: Data Persistence and Storage

**User Story:** As a user, I want my todo tasks to be saved locally on my device, so that my tasks persist between app sessions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app starts THEN the system SHALL initialize Hive local database
2. WHEN a task is created, updated, or deleted THEN the system SHALL persist changes to Hive storage
3. WHEN the app is reopened THEN the system SHALL load all previously saved tasks from local storage
4. IF storage operations fail THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages
5. WHEN tasks are stored THEN the system SHALL use TodoModel with fields: id (String), title (String), isCompleted (bool)

### Requirement 3: Architecture and State Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the app to follow strict architectural patterns, so that the code is maintainable, testable, and scalable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing state management THEN the system SHALL use BLoC pattern with TodoBloc, TodoEvent, and TodoState
2. WHEN managing dependencies THEN the system SHALL use GetIt for dependency injection
3. WHEN defining state THEN the system SHALL create immutable state classes extending Equatable with copyWith methods
4. WHEN handling events THEN the system SHALL implement LoadTodos, AddTodo, UpdateTodo, DeleteTodo events
5. WHEN organizing code THEN the system SHALL follow the specified folder structure with lib/core, lib/feature/todo, lib/product directories
6. WHEN managing data THEN the system SHALL use TodoCacheManager to abstract Hive operations

### Requirement 4: User Interface and Design

**User Story:** As a user, I want a modern, dark-themed interface that follows Material 3 design principles, so that I have a pleasant and consistent user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app launches THEN the system SHALL display only dark theme (no light theme or theme switching)
2. WHEN designing UI components THEN the system SHALL follow Material 3 design principles
3. WHEN displaying tasks THEN the system SHALL use ListView.builder with TodoListItemCard widgets
4. WHEN showing loading states THEN the system SHALL display CircularProgressIndicator
5. WHEN creating reusable components THEN the system SHALL implement CommonElevatedButton with loading state support
6. WHEN displaying completed tasks THEN the system SHALL show strikethrough text and updated icons

### Requirement 5: Navigation and Routing

**User Story:** As a user, I want smooth navigation within the app, so that I can easily access different features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing navigation THEN the system SHALL use AutoRoute for routing management
2. WHEN defining routes THEN the system SHALL create app_router.dart with TodoListRoute as initial route
3. WHEN navigating THEN the system SHALL handle route generation and navigation state properly

### Requirement 6: Internationalization and Localization

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to support multiple languages (Turkish and English), so that I can use the app in my preferred language.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing localization THEN the system SHALL use easy_localization package
2. WHEN defining translations THEN the system SHALL create tr-TR.json and en-US.json files
3. WHEN displaying text THEN the system SHALL use localized strings for app title, buttons, messages, and placeholders
4. WHEN the app starts THEN the system SHALL initialize localization with proper language detection

### Requirement 7: Error Handling and User Feedback

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear feedback when errors occur, so that I understand what went wrong and can take appropriate action.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages
2. WHEN storage operations fail THEN the system SHALL show localized error messages
3. WHEN loading data THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback with loading indicators
4. WHEN operations complete THEN the system SHALL update the UI to reflect the new state

### Requirement 8: Code Quality and Testing

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive tests and code quality measures, so that the application is reliable and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN writing code THEN the system SHALL follow very_good_analysis linting rules
2. WHEN testing BLoC THEN the system SHALL implement unit tests using bloc_test and mockito
3. WHEN testing events THEN the system SHALL verify AddTodo and DeleteTodo events update state correctly
4. WHEN mocking dependencies THEN the system SHALL mock TodoCacheManager for isolated testing
5. WHEN generating code THEN the system SHALL use build_runner for JSON serialization, Hive adapters, and AutoRoute generation

### Requirement 9: Dependencies and Configuration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want properly configured dependencies and build settings, so that the project builds and runs correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring Dart SDK THEN the system SHALL use version '>=3.1.3 <4.0.0'
2. WHEN adding dependencies THEN the system SHALL include flutter_bloc, get_it, equatable, hive, hive_flutter, auto_route, easy_localization, json_annotation
3. WHEN adding dev dependencies THEN the system SHALL include build_runner, hive_generator, auto_route_generator, json_serializable, mockito, bloc_test, very_good_analysis
4. WHEN building the project THEN the system SHALL generate all necessary .g.dart files using build_runner

### Requirement 10: Application Initialization

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to start quickly and reliably, so that I can begin using it immediately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app starts THEN the system SHALL initialize WidgetsFlutterBinding, EasyLocalization, and Hive
2. WHEN setting up dependencies THEN the system SHALL call DependencyInitialize.setup()
3. WHEN configuring the app THEN the system SHALL wrap the app with EasyLocalization and BlocProvider widgets
4. WHEN initializing theme THEN the system SHALL apply the dark theme configuration
5. WHEN the initialization completes THEN the system SHALL navigate to the main todo list view# Requirements Document
